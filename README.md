HR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Description

Our goal is to build a recruitment system on Salesforce that makes hiring simple, fast, and transparent. Instead of struggling with emails and spreadsheets, HR teams can manage job openings, track candidates, and schedule interviews all in one place. This not only saves time but also ensures a better experience for both recruiters and candidates.

PROCESS

Our recruitment process in the Salesforce HR Recruitment CRM starts with a job request raised by a department. Recruiters then source candidates through portals, referrals, or LinkedIn, followed by screening and shortlisting. Next, interviews are scheduled, feedback is collected, and approvals are obtained from department heads. Once approved, HR generates and sends the offer letter. Successful candidates move into the onboarding stage, and finally, the job opening is marked as closed. This streamlined flow ensures every step — from request to closure — is tracked and managed efficiently in one system.

Job Request → Candidate Sourcing → Screening → Interview → Approval → Offer → Onboarding → Closure.
